 There are seven major systems  (Interface, Food Logging, Notification, Profile, Filtering, Food, Meal) with four having sub systems. The one-way or  two-way arrows show the flow of information or commands from one system or subsystem to another. For example,  if a user wanted to input a new food product into the product, the process would be as follows: Interface gives a  6 command to Food Logging which then either uses manual input or calls the external Receipt Scanner or Barcode  Scanner API. Food Logging then transfers the information to the Food Database (Food DB), thus ending the process.
