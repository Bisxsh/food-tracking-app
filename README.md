# food-tracking-app
 Our system is developed using React Native to maximise the range of supporting target users.
 The core functionalities which make up our aim for the application are: 
- Tracking food expiry dates.
- Viewing information on food (nutrients, allergy information etc.)
- Reminders for food expiration dates.
- Recipe suggestions.
- Categorizing food stored in the userâ€™s inventory.
 Through this we hope to minimise the amount of food that is needlessly thrown away by users, which 
among a large enough user base will help to reduce food waste.

 There are seven major systems  (Interface, Food Logging, Notification, Profile, Filtering, Food, Meal) with four having sub systems. The one-way or  two-way arrows show the flow of information or commands from one system or subsystem to another.
